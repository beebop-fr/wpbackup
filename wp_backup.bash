# This script has initially been generated by ChatGPT.
# Prompts used:
# - Write a bash script to save a wordpress website into a zip archive. The zip archive should contain the wp-content folder inside a subfolder called files and a backup.sql file at the root of the archive which is a dump of the wordpress website database.
# - The script should extract DB_ variables from wp-config.php
# - Take WP_PATH from the first arg, working dir by default, BACKUP_PATH working dir by default
# - Use /tmp as temporary folder
# - Add time token in the temp folder to prevent issue if running concurrent
# - Error if wp-config.php does not exist in wp_path
# - Make sure dot files are also backed up
# - Add an optional command line arg to specify the name of the backup file (keeping the date token)
# - Add a help message if the wrong number of arguments is provided

# Function to display help message
